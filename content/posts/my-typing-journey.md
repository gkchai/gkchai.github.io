I noticed something different when I started my new job. My teammates had better typing speeds than what I was used to. They were taking down Quip notes with ease in our team meetings and discussions. Needless to say I felt a bit embarrassed at the thought of me taking down notes in full public view one day.

Then I came across a couple of online resources that strongly motivated me to improve my typing speed. With enough motivation in the tank and the burning desire to fit in at my new workplace I began my journey to master the art of typing.

I am happy to announce that after around 1 month and around 100 hrs later, I am comfortably typing at 60wpm with 95% accuracy.

I started at 35wpm with 80-90% accuracy.

I mainly used [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com), [10fastfingers.com](https://10fastfingers.com), [typeracer.com](https://play.typeracer.com), and [typingtest.com](https://www.typingtest.com) to practice and test myself.

I used keybr.com to track my progress:

The initial part of the curve is me trying to push as much as possible with my old typing style. No matter how hard I tried I could not exceed 50wpm and that too at a very high error rate.

Then I learnt touch typing.

First, it was the right hand. I reached up to 50wpm with the change. Then I learnt touch typing on the left hand. Finally I was able to cross the 50wpm barrier. Since then I have been focusing on reducing the number of errors.

### Update: 09/30/21

Comfortably typing between 75-80 wpm. Next goal is 100wpm.
