## Introspection for Senior and Staff engineers

* How to run a meeting, and no, being the person who talks the most in the meeting is not the same thing as running it
* How to write a design doc, take feedback, and drive it to resolution, in a reasonable period of time
* How to mentor an early-career teammate, a mid-career engineer, a new manager who needs technical advice
* How to indulge a senior manager who wants to talk about technical stuff that they don’t really understand, without 
rolling your eyes or making them feel stupid
* How to explain a technical concept behind closed doors to a senior person too embarrassed to openly admit that they 
don’t understand it
* How to influence another team to use your solution instead of writing their own
* How to get another engineer to do something for you by asking for help in a way that makes them feel appreciated
* How to lead a project even though you don’t manage any of the people working on the project
* How to get other engineers to listen to your ideas without making them feel threatened
* How to listen to other engineers’ ideas without feeling threatened
* How to give up your baby, that project that you built into something great, so you can do something else
* How to teach another engineer to care about that thing you really care about (operations, correctness, testing, 
code quality, performance, simplicity, etc)
* How to communicate project status to stakeholders
* How to convince management that they need to invest in a non-trivial technical project
* How to build software while delivering incremental value in the process
* How to craft a project proposal, socialize it, and get buy-in to execute it
* How to repeat yourself enough that people start to listen
* How to pick your battles
* How to help someone get promoted
* How to get information about what’s really happening (how to gossip, how to network)
* How to find interesting work on your own, instead of waiting for someone to bring it to you
* How to tell someone they’re wrong without making them feel ashamed
* How to take negative feedback gracefully

## [Hiring for T-shaped over I-shaped](https://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2022/t/)

Hiring T-shaped (one area of expertise with ability to collaborate) persons over I-shaped (expert) person. 

>  Ts are multipliers

The most impactful projects always had a T-shaped person onboard. This person would usually not be an expert in the 
subject matter, but would be able to provide the direly-needed scaffolding and foundation of a project that is all too often ignored in the initial phase, until it comes back later on with full swing to wreak havoc. This includes, for instance:
* Setting up a suitable build system.
* Writing some unit tests for the code.
* Creating a skeleton of the models that are to be developed.
* Designing nice mock-ups or logos.
* Creating animations or graphics for presentations.
