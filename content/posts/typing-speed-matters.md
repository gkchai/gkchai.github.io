As someone who grew up mastering the pen and paper, typing on a keyboard was always a second fiddle. Though my 
hunt-and-peck typing speed of 45wpm felt reasonable in the early days of my career, I gradually realized the 
below-average typing speed was setting me aback among my software engineer peers. Thankfully, I've been addressing this 
deficiency in the last few years. I picked up touch typing[^1], and as result increased my average typing 
speed to 75wpm[^2] (topping out at 95wpm on good days).

Faster typing has made a difference to my day-to-day activities -- programming, note-taking, doc-writing, 
messaging, and so on. Here are the reasons typing speed matters: 

- It saves a bunch of time. Assuming a typical software engineer types 500 words per day, going from a typing speed 
  45wpm to 75wpm will save 4.4 minutes per day, and 27hrs over a year.

- Improves communication. It becomes easier to respond to messages and less likely to lose a train of thought 
while typing; and if the typing is accurate, less likely to make typos.

- Reduces work fatigue, which contributes to one's level of happiness.
