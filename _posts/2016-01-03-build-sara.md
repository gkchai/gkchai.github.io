Unlicensed spectrum, much like a public park or a playground, is a public good.
It is a set of airwaves designated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
as open and free to all. Its purpose: to enable everyday low-power short-range
wireless devices like garage openers, cordless phones, baby monitors and medical
devices; to provide bandwidth for industrial, scientific and medical research (
ISM bands), commonly used by WiFi and Bluetooth; and to give free spectrum for
hobbyists and enterprises alike.
